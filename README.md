ABOUT BILL'S OFFICE

Bill's Office is a free and offline set of applications that let you do anything you need to do at work. We are inspired by Bill, who had so many coding projects 
to do with Discord moderating. But because of bad eating habits, he died before Google Docs could load and before Microsoft Word could be paid for.

INSTALLATION

Download the provided source code. I'm not sure why, but you must extract the source code into a folder in order for Bill's Office to work. Once you extract into a folder,
go into it, and find the file "bills-office.html". Double click on it so it opens in your browser. Then, bookmark the page so you don't have to keep going into the
folder.

USE

The Bill's Office homepage contains links to the five applications currently in Bill's Office:
-Bill's Documents
-Bill's Spreadsheets
-Bill's SlideShows
-Bill's Calculator
-Bill's Forms

BILL'S DOCUMENTS

Bill's Documents uses a standard <textarea> element, meaning that while you can change the formatting of text while typing, you can only save it as a text file with no
formatting to it.
  
BILL'S SPREADSHEETS
  
Like Bill's Documents, Bill's Spreadsheets uses standard <textarea> elements. Currently, you cannot save a spreadsheet.
  
 BILL'S SLIDESHOWS

A total of ten slides can be created. Currently, you can save each slide's body as a text file.
  
 BILL'S CALCULATOR
 
 Bill's Calculator is a generic Javascript calculator, but gets the work done. You must click the numbers and the equal sign. Typing the numbers and pressing
  the 'enter' key does not work.
  
 Bill's Forms
 
 There is currently no server for Bill's Office, so Bill's Forms can only be used for local use.
